📊 Amazon Sales Data Analysis 2025

AI-assisted end-to-end sales analysis uncovering revenue insights, customer behaviour, and business risks from 250 Amazon transactions.

1. Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of Amazon's 2025 sales dataset comprising 250 orders, 10 U.S. cities, 5 product categories, and 5 payment methods. The goal was to extract meaningful business intelligence and deliver a professionally formatted, stakeholder-ready report complete with visualisations and strategic recommendations.
2. Key Findings
The analysis uncovered $243,845 in total revenue with an average order value of $975. Electronics and Home Appliances dominate at 96% of all revenue. Miami leads geographically at $31,700 in sales, while Seattle records the highest average order value at $1,222. PayPal emerged as the most preferred payment method. A critical 30.8% cancellation rate — six times the industry benchmark — was flagged as an urgent business risk representing over $75,000 in lost revenue.
3. Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy) was used for data cleaning and visualisation. Power BI supported dashboard creation and clustered column analysis. Claude AI accelerated insight generation, chart scripting, and automated report writing throughout the entire workflow.
4. Deliverables
Five custom charts were produced including pie charts, histograms, bar charts, and trend lines. A full 8-section Word report was generated covering KPI cards, data tables, geographic analysis, payment behaviour, order status breakdown, and five prioritised strategic recommendations for leadership review.
